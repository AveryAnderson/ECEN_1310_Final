# ECEN_1310_Final
The miniMouse program was the final project for my ECEN 1310 Intro to C Programming Class in Spring 2017.  This program takes a maze of variable size with non-fixed start and end points and will apply a depth first search in order to find a path from the start square (denoted S) to the end square (denoted E)
