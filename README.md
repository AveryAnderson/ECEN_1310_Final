# ECEN_1310_Final
The miniMouse program was the final project for my ECEN 1310 Intro to C Programming Class in Spring 2017.  This program takes a maze of variable size with non-fixed start and end points and will apply a depth first search in order to find a path from the start square to the end square.

The files need to be formatted as a maze matrix such that each "maze space" and "wall space" is represented.  This means that an nxm maze will be represented by a 2n-1 * 2m-1 matrix.  Horizontal walls are represented by the pip character '|', vertical walls are represented by a dash '-', an open wall is denoted with a zero, a path space is denoted 'p', and the start and end spaces are 'S' and 'E' respectively.  There are four example mazes included within this project as well as instructions on how to call this program with each maze found by running ./minimouse -h
